  dzen, (c) 2007 by Robert Manea
==================================

A general purpose messaging, notification and launcher program. 
Dzen can be used in a single line and/or multiple lines mode. 



Features
--------

    * scriptable in any language
    * single line and/or windows 
      holding multiple lines
    * menu functionality
    * flexible event/action 
      mechanism
    * hideable, collapsable


Requirements
------------
In order to build dzen you need the Xlib and phtread header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dzen is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dzen (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

Feature requests, patches or anything else related to dzen can be send

Running dzen
------------
dzen accepts a couple of options:

    -fg     foreground color
    -bg     background color
    -fn     font 
    -a      autohide, see 1)
    -l      lines, see 2)
    -e      events and actions, see 3)
    -m      menu, see 4)
    -p      persistent, never time out
    -x      x position
    -y      y position
    -w      width
    -tw     title window width
    -v      version information

Termination:
------------
dzen2 uses two different approaches to terminate itself:

    * If EOF is received -> terminate
        - unless the '-p' flag is set

    * If mouse button3 is clicked -> terminate
        - this is the default behaviour, see 3)


Return values:
--------------
0               -   dzen received EOF
1               -   some error occured, inspect the error message
user defined    -   set with 'exit:retval' action, see 3)



1) Option "-a": Autohide
------------------------

Hides the title window as soon as the pointer leaves it (default). This
very much resembles autohiding panels known from most desktops.

Note:   This option is obsolete and will be removed in future versions as
        the same behaviour can be achieved with the 'onstart=hide' combination,
        see 3) for further details.


2) Option "-l": Slave window
--------------------------------

Enables support for displaying multiple lines. The parameter to "-l"
specifies the number of lines to be displayed.

These lines of input are held in the slave window which becomes active as soon
as the pointer enters the title (default action) window.

If the mouse leaves the slave window it will be hidden unless it is set
sticky by clicking with Button2 into it (default action).

Button4 and Button5 (mouse wheel) will scroll the slave window up
and down if the content exceeds the window height (default action).


3) Option '-e': Events and actions
----------------------------------

dzen allows the user to associate actions to events.

The command line syntax is as follows:
-e 'event1=action1:option1:...option<n>,...,action<m>;...;event<l>'

Every event can take any number of actions and every action can take any number
of options. (Currently limited to 256 each)

An example:
    -e 'button1=exec:xterm:firefox;entertitle=uncollapse,unhide;button3=exit'

    Meaning:

    button1=exec:xterm:firefox;
    on Button1 event (Button1 press on the mouse) execute xterm and
    firefox. 
    (Note: xterm and firefox are options to the exec action)

    entertitle=uncollapse,unhide;
    on entertitle (mouse pointer enters the title window) uncollapse
    slave window and unhide the title window

    button3=exit
    on button3 event exit dzen


Supported events:
    onstart             Perform actions right after startup
    onquit              Perform actions just before quitting
    button1             Mouse button1 released 
    button2             Mouse button2 released
    button3             Mouse button3 released
    button4             Mouse button4 released (usually scrollwheel)
    button5             Mouse button5 released (usually scrollwheel)
    entertitle          Mouse enters the title window
    leavetitle          Mouse leaves the title window
    enterslave          Mouse enters the slave window
    leaveslave          Mouse leaves the slave window
    sigusr1             SIGUSR1 received 
    sigusr2             SIGUSR2 received

Supported actions:
    exec:command1:..:n  execute all given options
    menuexec            executes selected menu entry
    exit:retval         exit dzen and return 'retval'
    print:str1:...:n    write all given options to STDOUT
    menuprint           write selected menu entry to STDOUT
    collapse            collapse slave window
    uncollapse          uncollapse slave window
    stick               stick slave window
    unstick             unstick slave window
    togglestick         toggle sticky state
    hide                hide title window
    unhide              unhide title window
    scrollup            scroll slave window one line up
    scrolldown          scroll slave window one line down


Note:   If no events/actions are specified dzen defaults to:

        -e 'entertitle=uncollapse;leaveslave=collapse;
            button1=menuexec;
            button2=togglestick;button3=exit:13;
            button4=scrollup;button5=scrolldown'

        If you define any events/actions, there is no default behaviour,
        i.e. you will have to specify _all_ events/actions you want to
        use.


4) Option '-m', Menu
--------------------

If menu mode is activated the line under the pointer will be
highlighted. 
All actions beginning with "menu" work on the selected menu entry.

Note:   Menu mode only makes sense if '-l <n>' is specified!



Examples:
---------

* Display message and timeout after 10 seconds:
    (echo "This is a message"; sleep 10) | dzen2 -bg darkred -fg grey80 -fn fixed 

* Display message and never timeout:
    echo "This is a message"| dzen2 -p

* Display updating single line message:
    for i in $(seq 1 20); do A=${A}'='; print $A; sleep 1; done | dzen2

* Display header and a message with multiple lines:
    (echo Header; cal; sleep 20) | dzen2 -l 8

    Displays "Header" in the main alert window and
    the output of cal in the 8 lines high slave
    window.

* Display updating messages:
    (echo Header; while true; do echo test$((i++)); sleep 1; done) | dzen2 -l 12

    The slave window will update contents if new input has arrived.

* Display log files:
    (su -c "echo LOGFILENAME; tail -f /var/log/messages") | dzen2 -l 20 -x 100 -y 300 -w 500

* Monthly schedule with remind:
    (echo Monthly Schedule; remind -c1 -m) | dzen2 -l 52 -w 410 -p -fn lime -bg '#e0e8ea' -fg black -x 635

* Simple menu:
    echo "Applications" | dzen2 -l 4 -p -m < menufile

* Menu without any files:
    {echo Menu; echo -e "xterm\nxclock\nxeyes\nxfontsel"} | dzen2 -l 4 -m -p

* Extract PIDs from the process table

    {echo Procs; ps -a} | dzen2 -m -l 12 -p -e 'button1=menuprint;button3=exit;
            button4=scrollup;button5=scrolldown;entertitle=uncollapse;leaveslave=collapse' 
            | awk '{print $1}'



Have fun.
